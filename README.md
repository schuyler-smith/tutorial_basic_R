# Tutorial_Basic_R

[Basic R Tutorial Website][Tut]

I made this tutorial to for workshops that myself and a two colleagues ([Paul Villanueva][P] and [Ian Braun][I]) taught for incoming graduate students into biological sciences and other related fields.

In many cases, students who study biology during their undergradate degree are not presented with the value of knowing a scripting/programming language. Moreso, how approachable it can be to learn and use! I certainly know that was the case for myself.

My hope is to present an introduction to R in a welcoming way and to provide a strong foundation of understanding to build upon.

This is my tutorial, there are many like it, but this one is mine.

# Why R?

[What is R?][Rwhat]

Essentially, R is a language that was made to handle complex statistics, working with numerical matrices and data-frames. The strength of R over other languages lies in its statistics, linear algebra, and especially ability to make graphs and figures from data.
