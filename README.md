# Tutorial_Basic_R

[Tutorial Website][Tut]

I made this tutorial to for workshops that myself and a two colleagues ([Paull Villanueva][P] and [Ian Braun][I]) taught for incoming graduate students into biological sciences and other related fields.

In many cases, students who study biology during their undergrad are not presented with the value that computer science has, and moresor how approachable it can be! I know that was the case for myself.

This is my tutorial, there are many like it, but this is mine.
