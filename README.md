I made this tutorial to for workshops that myself and a two colleagues ([Paul Villanueva][P] and [Ian Braun][I]) taught for incoming graduate students into biological sciences and other related fields.

In many cases, students who study biology during their undergradate degree are not presented with the value of knowing a scripting/programming language. Moreso, how approachable it can be to learn and use! I certainly know that was the case for myself.

My hope is to present an introduction to R in a welcoming way and to provide a strong foundation of understanding to build upon.

This is my tutorial, there are many like it, but this one is mine.
